# mce: Markdown Code Extractor

Rust macros to extract part(s) of README.md (or a similar Markdown file) and to use those parts in
tests/doctests/elsewhere.

## MSRV
MSRV (minimum supported Rust version), as indicated with `rust-version` in
[`Cargo.toml`](Cargo.toml), is 1.88.0. However, you will get incorrect (false positive) `dead_code`
warnings, unless you use Rust 1.89.0+. It's tested only with Rust 1.89.0+. (See
[rust-lang/rust#142208](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/142208).)
